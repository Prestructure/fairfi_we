Discussions about the FairFi Protocol and Infrastructure

Bringing inference to data vs data to inference is a core principle of the FairFi project. 
Self-sovereign data and trusted compute can be achieved in a variety of architectures.

This repo explores the underpinnings of a trusted enterprise, likely formed as a member directed cooperative entity (State and potenially Federal licensed in 2026).

## Mesh Orchestration
**Kamiwaza** offers a platform that manages models, data, and agent driven inference. 

FairFi's use case always begins with the individual, but aims to create cooperation and competitive data density through members' de-identified data sharing. The deliniations between and individual's data and patronage-driving shared benefits is outside of the scope of this project, but the **Kamiwaza** platform is an example of a core infrastructure that would support cooperative outcomes based on individual data.

## FairFi_me implementation on FairFi_we
This notebook, while implemented on a potentially shared infrastructure, is a proof of concept for fairfi_me, the one-user private implementation of FairFi financial tools.

## Hypothesis##
**Kamiwaza** Community Edition can provide a secure inference layer to handle retail receipt image OCR and content embedding (with local index) and answer the longitudinal detection of "price deltas for like items."

## Architecture
Based on the **Kamiwaza** full-stack, we will attempt to implement a simple **App Garden** implementation of the above hypothesis.

## Process
1. Hello Receipt Notebook
2. Pythond SDK spp
3. App Garden
